  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. This App is a command-line application that will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

  ## Usage
  The user begins by clicking the Start Quiz button.  From there a 60 second clock begins to decrement.  5 questions are rendered.  The score is determined based upon the number of seconds remaining on the clock after all five questions are completed.  Each incorrect response decrements an extra 10 seconds.  A user can save their score with their initials.  High scores can be viewed by clicking the link on the top left at any time.
  
  ## User Story
